## Stage 1: Eligibility Check

### Purpose

The eligibility check is an automated first-stage filter that determines if a project meets basic requirements before proceeding to detailed evaluation.

### How It Works

```
Supplier submits pre-screening questionnaire
    |
System evaluates against criteria
    |
PASS -> Proceeds to Screening Phase 1
    or
FAIL -> Supplier notified, can appeal
```

### Evaluation Criteria

The eligibility check evaluates binary criteria such as:

| Criterion | Pass Condition |
|-----------|----------------|
| Project type | Is an eligible type (Reforestation, Agroforestry, Mangrove) |
| Project country | Not in excluded countries |
| Has Project Design Document | Yes |
| Has KML boundary file | Yes |
| Methodology | Uses approved methodology |
