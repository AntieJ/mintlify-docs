## Advancing Proposals

### Manual Advancement

1. Open the proposal detail page
2. Review all submitted information
3. Verify scorecard scores
4. Click **'Advance to Next Stage'**
5. Confirm the action

### Advancement Prerequisites

Before advancing, ensure:
- All stage questions have been answered
- Scorecard review is complete
- Manual tasks are completed (if applicable)
- No blocking issues identified

### Automatic Advancement

For stages configured with "Auto on Submit":
- Proposal automatically advances when supplier submits
- Rule-based criteria are evaluated
- Notifications sent to relevant parties

### Stage Transition Logging

All stage transitions are logged with:
- Timestamp
- User who performed the action
- Previous stage
- New stage
- Any notes or reasons provided

---

## Rejecting Proposals

### Rejection Process

1. Open the proposal detail page
2. Click **'Reject Proposal'**
3. Complete mandatory rejection fields:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Reason Category** | Yes | Select from dropdown |
| **Detailed Explanation** | Yes | Text explanation of rejection |
| **Supporting Evidence** | No | Optional file upload |

4. Review and confirm rejection

### Rejection at Different Stages

| Stage | Rejection Implications |
|-------|----------------------|
| Eligibility Check | Automatic based on criteria; appeal available |
| Screening Phases | Manual rejection with reason required |
| DD Stages | Manual rejection with detailed feedback |

### Communicating Rejections

Suppliers receive notification of rejection:
- Rejection reason (category)
- Feedback if provided
- Appeal option (if available)

---

## Bulk Actions

### Selecting Multiple Proposals

1. Use checkboxes in proposals table
2. Or use "Select All" for current view
3. Bulk action menu becomes available

### Available Bulk Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Advance Stage** | Move all selected to next stage |
| **Change Status** | Update status for all selected |
| **Add to Shortlist** | Add all to a shortlist |
| **Export** | Export selected proposals |

### Bulk Advancement Considerations

- All selected proposals must be at the same stage
- All prerequisites must be met for each proposal
- Individual failures don't block others
- Summary of results shown after completion

---

## Stage Transition Rules

### Backward Movement

In some cases, proposals may need to move backward:

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Appeal Overturned** | Returns to previous stage |
| **New Information Received** | May require re-evaluation |
| **Error Correction** | Admin can move backward |

### Movement Restrictions

| User Type | Can Advance | Can Reject | Can Move Backward |
|-----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| Abatable Admin | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Symbiosis Staff | Yes | Yes | No (request admin) |
| Symbiosis Members | No | No | No |
| DD Vendors | No | No | No |

## Notifications

### Stage Change Notifications

| Event | Who's Notified |
|-------|----------------|
| Proposal Submitted | Buyer team |
| Stage Advanced | Supplier |
| Proposal Rejected | Supplier |

### Notification Channels

- In-platform notifications
- Email notifications (configurable)

---

## Best Practices

### Review Efficiency
- Complete scorecard review before stage decision
- Use checklists for manual task completion
- Document reasoning in notes before advancing

### Rejection Quality
- Provide clear, actionable feedback
- Use consistent reason categories
- Include specific examples where possible

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Cannot advance proposal | Check all prerequisites are met |
