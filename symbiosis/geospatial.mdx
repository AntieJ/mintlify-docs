## Overview

This guide covers Screening Phase 2 (Stage 3), which focuses on geospatial analysis review. At this stage, the KML boundary analysis is evaluated in detail.

---

## Stage 3: Screening Phase 2

### Purpose

Detailed geospatial analysis to assess:
- Land suitability and eligibility
- Environmental risk factors
- Boundary validity
- Compliance with location requirements

### Workflow

```
Proposal passes Screening Phase 1
    |
Automated geospatial analysis (from KML)
    |
Manual geospatial review
    |
Score updates based on analysis
    |
Decision: Advance or Reject
```

## Geospatial Analysis Results

### What's Analysed

The geospatial analysis generates 100+ metrics using the supplier's KML file. Key areas include:

| Analysis Area | Key Features | Data Source |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Area for Planting** | Suitable land cover %, Eligible land area | Google Dynamic World, ESA WorldCover |
| **Protected Areas** | Overlap %, Regulatory risk | WDPA |
| **Forest Cover** | Forest/Non-forest area, Total forest loss | PALSAR-2 FNF dataset |
| **Biome** | Biome diversity, Dominant biome | RESOLVE Ecoregions 2017 |
| **Terrain** | Average slope, Terrain roughness | ALOS Digital Surface Model |
| **Deforestation Risk** | Stability %, Avg annual rate, Loss drivers | WRI/Google DeepMind Global |
| **Fire Risk** | Burned area %, Avg monthly burn | MODIS Burned Area |
| **Drought Risk** | Recent average SPEI, Drought frequency | SPEI Index |
| **Climate Impact (ARR)** | Median climate impact, Variability | Hastler et al. 2024 |
| **Regeneration (ARR)** | High PNR coverage, Average PNR | Williams 2024 PNR |
| **Cost-Effectiveness** | Cost per hectare, Implementation costs | Busch et al. 2024 |
| **Growth Potential** | Annual average GPP | MODIS MOD17A2H |
| **Biodiversity** | Water stress, Biodiversity intactness | WRI Aqueduct, Hudson 2017 |

### Viewing Results

1. Open proposal at Screening Phase 2
2. Navigate to **Geospatial Analysis** section
3. View:
   - Summary scores
   - Map visualization
   - Layer-by-layer results

### Map View

The map view shows:
- Project boundary (from KML)
- Overlays of analysis layers
- Risk indicators
- Toggle layers on/off

## Interpreting Results

### Key Metrics to Review

| Category | Metric | Low Risk | High Risk |
|----------|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Land Suitability** | Suitable land cover % | &gt;50% | &lt;20% |
| **Protected Areas** | Protected area overlap % | &lt;5% | &gt;15% |
| **Forest** | Avg annual deforestation rate | &lt;0.5% | &gt;1.5% |
| **Fire** | Burned area % (5yr) | &lt;1% | &gt;5% |
| **Drought** | Drought frequency | &lt;15% | &gt;30% |
| **Climate Impact** | Median climate impact | &gt;200 tCO2e/ha | &lt;100 tCO2e/ha |
| **Regeneration** | High PNR coverage | &gt;30% | &lt;10% |
| **Terrain** | Average slope | &lt;15 degrees | &gt;30 degrees |

### Risk Indicators

| Indicator | Low | Medium | High |
|-----------|-----|--------|------|
| **Fire Risk** | &lt;1% burned area | 1-3% burned | &gt;3% burned |
| **Deforestation Pressure** | &lt;3% regional loss | 3-6% loss | &gt;6% regional loss |
| **Drought Risk** | SPEI &gt;0.5 | SPEI 0 to -1 | SPEI &lt;-1 |

### Boundary Issues

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| **Invalid geometry** | Cannot proceed; request correction |
| **Multiple polygons** | May need clarification |
| **Boundary overlap** | With protected areas, etc. |
| **Area mismatch** | Stated vs calculated area |

### Compliance Checks

| Check | Pass | Fail |
|-------|------|------|
| **Protected Area Overlap** | No overlap or acceptable | Significant overlap |
| **Land Eligibility** | Suitable for project type | Not suitable |
| **Location Accuracy** | Matches project description | Discrepancy |

## Geospatial

### When Manual Review is Needed

- Automated results need verification
- Borderline cases
- Complex boundary situations
- Risk interpretation required

### Manual Review Process

Conducted by Peter Wooldridge:

1. Cross-reference with imagery
2. Verify boundary accuracy
3. Interpret risk assessments
4. Recommend score adjustments

### Flagging for Manual Review

If you identify issues:
1. Add note on proposal
2. Flag in `#due_diligence` channel
3. Request manual geospatial review

---

## Score Updates

### Geospatial Impact on Scores

Geospatial analysis affects scorecard:
- Delivery Risk (location risks)
- Project Quality (environmental factors)

### Reviewing Updated Scores

After geospatial analysis:
1. View updated scorecard
2. Compare to Phase 1 scores
3. Identify changes

### Overriding Based on Geo Results

If manual review warrants adjustment:
1. Override relevant scores
2. Document geospatial findings as reason
3. Reference specific analysis results

---

## Making Decisions

### Advancing

When geospatial analysis supports advancement:
1. Confirm all analysis complete
2. Review any manual review findings
3. Click **'Advance to Intermediate DD'**
4. Supplier notified

### Rejecting

When geospatial issues are disqualifying:
1. Click **'Reject Proposal'**
2. Select reason related to geospatial issues
3. Provide specific findings
4. Reference analysis results

### Common Rejection Reasons

- Significant protected area overlap
- Land not suitable for carbon project
- High risk scores indicating project viability concerns
- Boundary discrepancies
