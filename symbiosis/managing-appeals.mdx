## Common Appeal Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Missing Document

**Situation:** Failed eligibility due to missing PDD.

**Review Steps:**
- Check if document was uploaded but not linked
- Review appeal for explanation
- If document now provided in appeal, consider overturning

**Decision Guidance:**
- Overturn if document is now valid and complete
- Uphold if document still missing or insufficient

### Scenario 2: Methodology Question

**Situation:** Supplier claims methodology is approved but failed eligibility.

**Review Steps:**
- Verify against approved methodology list
- Check methodology version
- Review supplier's evidence

**Decision Guidance:**
- Overturn if methodology is actually approved
- Uphold if methodology remains ineligible
- Escalate if unclear

### Scenario 3: Score-Based Rejection

**Situation:** Rejected based on scorecard scores.

**Review Steps:**
- Review original scores
- Check supplier's counter-arguments
- Consider if scores should be overridden

**Decision Guidance:**
- Overturn if new evidence changes score assessment
- Uphold if scores remain valid
