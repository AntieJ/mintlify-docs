## Geospatial Analysis

The geospatial analysis generates 100+ metrics using the supplier's KML file. These are structured around **Suitability** (assessing the project area's appropriateness) and **Eligibility** (compliance with certification standards).

{.compact}
| Category | Analysis Area | Key Features |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Land Suitability** | Land Cover | Suitable land %, Land cover diversity, Available planting area |
| **Land Suitability** | Terrain | Average slope, Terrain roughness, Elevation range |
| **Additionality** | Protected Areas | Overlap %, Regulatory risk, Conservation priority |
| **Additionality** | Natural Regeneration (PNR) | High PNR coverage, Average PNR score |
| **Additionality** | Opportunity Cost | Cost score, Market accessibility |
| **Durability** | Fire Risk | Burned area %, Historical fire frequency |
| **Durability** | Drought & Water Stress | Recent average SPEI, Drought frequency, Water stress |
| **Durability** | Forest Loss | Forest stability, Deforestation rate, Loss drivers |
| **Carbon Accounting** | Climate Impact | Median climate impact, Variability |
| **Carbon Accounting** | Growth Potential | Annual average GPP/NPP, NDVI trends |
| **Carbon Accounting** | Soil Quality | Soil quality score, Soil organic carbon, Soil texture |
| **Ecological Integrity** | Biodiversity | Biodiversity intactness, Habitat connectivity |
| **Ecological Integrity** | Forest Landscapes | IFL coverage, Forest fragmentation |
| **Social & Community** | Indigenous & Community Lands | Territory overlap %, Community land overlap |

### Viewing Results

1. Open proposal at Screening Phase 2
2. Navigate to **Geospatial Analysis** section
3. View:
   - Summary scores
   - Map visualization
   - Layer-by-layer results

### Map View

The map view shows:
- Project boundary (from KML)
- Overlays of analysis layers
- Risk indicators
- Toggle layers on/off
