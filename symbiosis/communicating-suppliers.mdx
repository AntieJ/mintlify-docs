## Requesting Additional Information

### When to Request

Request additional information when:
- Submission is incomplete
- Clarification needed
- Updated documents required
- Follow-up questions arise

### Making a Request

1. Open the **proposal detail page**
2. Navigate to **'Request Information'** or equivalent
3. Specify what you need:
   - Documents requested
   - Questions to answer
   - Deadline (if applicable)
4. Submit request

### Request Template

Include:
- Clear description of what's needed
- Why it's needed
- Format expected
- Deadline if applicable

**Example:**
> "Please provide an updated KML file for your project boundary. The current file appears to have an invalid geometry in the northern section. Please upload a corrected version by [date]."

### Tracking Requests

- Requests are logged on the proposal
- Status: Pending, Responded, Overdue
- Notification when supplier responds

## Providing Feedback

### Rejection Feedback

When rejecting a proposal, provide feedback:

1. Complete the **rejection form**
2. Select **reason category**
3. Provide **detailed explanation**
4. Add **specific examples** where possible

### Good Feedback Practices

**Do:**
- Be specific about the issue
- Reference specific criteria
- Suggest what could be improved
- Be professional and constructive

**Don't:**
- Be vague ("doesn't meet requirements")
- Be personal or harsh
- Make promises about future acceptance

### Example Feedback

If your project obtains approval for an eligible methodology, you may be eligible for future RFP rounds."
