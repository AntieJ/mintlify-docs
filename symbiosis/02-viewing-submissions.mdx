## RFP Summary

After selecting the Symbiosis RFP, the procurement summary page displays.

### Header

The header shows key procurement parameters:

- **Total volume required** — e.g. 20,000,000 tCO₂e
- **Delivery period** — e.g. Jan 2030
- **Budget**
- **Rolling** badge (indicates the RFP accepts submissions on a rolling basis)

A status sidebar on the right shows the current status, last updated timestamp, number of stages, and total submissions.

### RFP Details

The **RFP details** section is collapsible and shows configuration completeness for:

- Procurement targets
- Project criteria
- Instructions and FAQs
- Questionnaire and stages
- Buyer details

Each row displays a completion count (e.g. 3/3) and a **Completed** badge. Click **'View'** on any row to see its details.

### Submitted Proposals

Below RFP details, the **Submitted proposals** section shows a summary card with:

- **Suppliers onboarded** — number of suppliers registered
- **Proposals submitted** — total proposals received
- **Total volume offered** — aggregate tCO₂e across all proposals

A **Proposals pipeline** bar chart shows the number of proposals at each stage, colour-coded by status.

## Submissions Overview

To view the full submissions overview, expand the **Submitted proposals** section and click **'View'**. This opens the **Submitted project proposals** page.

The page has two tabs: **Overview** and **Proposals list**.

### Overview Tab

The pipeline chart uses a colour-coded legend:

## Proposals List

Click the **Proposals list** tab to view all submissions in a table.

### Stage Tabs

Stage tabs appear above the table to filter proposals by procurement stage:

- **All** — shows every proposal with a total count
- **Pre-Screening** — proposals at the pre-screening stage
- **Screening** — proposals at the screening stage

Each tab displays the number of proposals in brackets (e.g. Pre-Screening (2)).

### Table Columns

The proposals table displays the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Project name / Project ID** | The supplier's project name and unique identifier |
| **Supplier / Role** | Submitting organisation and their role |
| **Project country** | Project location |
| **Project type** | e.g. Reforestation, Agroforestry, Mangrove |
| **Procurement stage** | Current stage in the procurement workflow |
| **Proposal status** | Current status of the proposal |

Each column header supports sorting — click the arrows to sort ascending or descending.

### Searching and Filtering

- **Search** — type in the search box (top right) to filter proposals by name. The count updates to show matching results (e.g. "2 submitted proposals out of 3")
- **Filters** — click the **'Filters'** button to apply additional filter criteria

### Favouriting Proposals

Click the star icon next to a project name to mark it as a favourite for quick reference.

### Pagination

Use the **Rows per page** dropdown at the bottom to control how many proposals display per page (default: 10). Navigation arrows allow paging through results.
